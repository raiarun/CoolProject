How to run the program ?
# This is a shellscript based program. A user needs to open the terminal window in Unix 
(fedora, ubuntu, redhat or other Unix distrubutions) in order to run this program.
  The following commands need to be run:
  
  1. Open the terminal and navigate to your local directory where you want a copy of the program. For eg. 
    $ cd ~/ece2524/localdir.
  2. Clone a copy of the project to your local directory as - $ git clone htttps://github.com/raiarun/CoolProject.git
  3. Now you have a copy of the program in your local directory. Make the file - employee.sh - executable by
     running a command : $ chmod +755 employee.sh
  4. Run the command - $./employee.sh in the repository that you want to start building the employee directory in.
  5. Then enter information about the employee, ex. Name, Position, Salary, Email, Phone Number.
  6. A main directory named 'EmployeeInfo' will be creaed. You can 'cd' into the directory and 
    it's subdirectory and finally open a file named with the employee's name containing the information you just entered.
  7. You may open the file with 'Nano' or 'Emacs' : run command - $ emacs file or $ nano file
  8. To remove a file : run command - $ rm file - and to remove a directory : run command -
    $ rm -r directory.
